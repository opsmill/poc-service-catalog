import ReferenceLink from "../../src/components/Card";

In this walkthrough, we detail the key building blocks of the demo, explain how it works, and describe how the components interact. This guide is intended for developers who want to understand the implementation details of the service catalog PoC.

## The schema

To structure and store data, we define a schema in Infrahub. You can find the schema files in the `schemas` folder.

### Consuming the schema library

Much of the schema is based on the [Infrahub schema library](https://github.com/opsmill/schema-library), which provides reusable schema components for quickly scaffolding a schema.

- `base`: Contains generic definitions for `IPAM` (IP address, prefix, etc.), `DCIM` (network device, interface, etc.), `location`, and `organization` (provider, manufacturer). Importing this folder is mandatory as it provides the basic definitions required for extensions.
- `location_minimal`: Defines a hierarchical tree for country, metro, and site.
- `vlan`: Includes nodes for VLANs and L2 domains.

### Custom service schema

The service layer is unique to each organization, so we define a custom schema to represent services and their components.

```yaml title="/schemas/service/service.yml"

  # To enable future expansions, we define a generic service object.

  # Additionally, we can leverage this generic structure to simplify relationships.

      # By configuring directions in relationships to point toward the generic service from a site’s perspective and initiating the relationship in the node pointing toward the site, we achieve the desired behavior.

:::success

We now have the data model and data to support our use case. It captures everything from services to the backbone, with some abstraction for flexibility. This setup is a strong foundation for automation.

## The generator

The generator is a powerful feature of Infrahub that allows you to codify the rules and processes associated with your service implementation. It enables fast and consistent implementation across the board.

:::important

We want to build the generator with the concept of **idempotency** in mind, meaning it should be repeatable: it assigns resources the first time it runs, and if run again, it changes nothing if the desired state is already achieved. This approach ensures the code is robust and predictable.

Infrahub provides a set of features to help:
- Resource manager: It allows users to create pools and allocate resources from them, such as prefixes, IP addresses, or even numbers. We will use this feature to allocate our prefixes/vlan in a branch-agnostic and idempotent way. Learn more about [resource managers](https://docs.infrahub.app/topics/resource-manager).
- `allow_upsert=True`: This parameter is provided when saving the node, allowing it to be created if it doesn't exist or updated if it does. This is useful for ensuring that the generator can run multiple times without creating duplicates or errors.
